<Definition name="Arithmetic Series and Sequences">
An arithmetic series is $a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}\ldots $ where $a_{i}-a_{i-1}=d$ for some constant $d$ and all $i\ge 2$. Note that an arithmetic series refers to the **sum** while an arithmetic sequence refers to the **ordered list of terms**.[^1]
</Definition>

[^1]: Sometimes, an arithmetic sequence or series starts with index $0$, making it **zero-indexed**. The same formulas still apply but you will have to adjust the indexes accordingly.

Using this definition, we can now derive some formulas for each term and the series.

<Theorem name="Formula For Term">
If $a_{i}$ is $i$th term of an arithmetic sequence with common difference $d$, then $a_{i}=a_{1}+(i-1)d$.
</Theorem>

Now, we'll present some common formulas for arithmetic series and sequences. These all easily follow from the previous formula but it's useful to know them to quickly manipulate arithmetic series.

<Theorem name="Arithmetic Average">
In an arithmetic series $a_{i}$, $a_{n}+a_{m}=2a_{\frac{n+m}{2}}$ if $n+m$ is even.
</Theorem>

In other words, the arithmetic average of two terms is the term with an index that is the arithmetic average of the two other terms' indexes. Visually, the term in the very middle of the two terms is the arithmetic average.

<Proof>
We have $a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)d$ and $a_{m}=a_{1}+(m-1)d$. Then, $a_{n}+a_{m}=2a_{1}+(n+m-2)d=2(a_{1}+(\frac{n+m}{2}-1)d)=2a_{\frac{n+m}{2}}$
</Proof>


<Theorem name="Arithmetic Sequence and Series">
For an arithmetic sequence $a_{i}$, $a_{1}+a_{2}\ldots + a_{n}=\frac{a_{1}+a_{n}}{2}\cdot n$.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
Note that we can pair up $a_{i}$ and $a_{n+1-i}$ to get $a_{1}+(i-1)d+a_{1}+(n-i)d=2a_{1}+(n-1)d$. There is a special case that if $n$ is odd and $i=\frac{n+1}{2}$, we can't pair up that term with itself. However, $a_{\frac{n+1}{2}}=a_{1}+\frac{n-1}{2}d$ so it still averages out as $\frac{1}{2}$ of a pair.

Then, we have $\frac{n}{2}$ pairs (if $n$ is odd, we have a "half" pair which is just the term $a_{\frac{1+n}{2}}=\frac{a_{1}+a_{n}}{2}$). So, our total sum is
$\frac{n}{2}\cdot (a_{1}+a_{n})=\frac{a_{1}+a_{n}}{2}\cdot n$.
</Proof>

<Theorem name="Arithmetic Series">
If the common difference is $d$ in arithmetic sequence $a_{i}$, $a_{1}+a_{2}\ldots + a_{n}=n\cdot a_{1}+d(\frac{(n-1)(n)}{2})$.
</Theorem>

<Proof>
We use the previous theorem
$$a_{1}+a_{2}\ldots + a_{n}$$
$$=\frac{a_{1}+a_{n}}{2}\cdot n$$
$$=\frac{a_{1}+a_{1}+(n-1)d}{2}\cdot n$$
$$=a_{1}\cdot n + d(\frac{(n-1)(n)}{2})$$
</Proof>

Most of time, problems with arithmetic series require only simple algebraic manipulation to solve.

<Example source="NanoMath Fall Meet 2020" answer = "4">
Let $a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots$ be an arithmetic sequence of positive integers. If $a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{10} = 209$ and $a_{a_{0}} +
a_{a_{1}} + \cdots + a_{a_{10}} = 671$, then find $a_0$.
</Example>

<Solution>
Using our series formula on $a_0 + a_1 + \cdots + a_{10} = 209$ gives that $11\cdot \frac{a_{0}+a_{10}}{2}=209\implies a_{0}+a_{10}=38\implies 2a_{0}+10d=38$.

Now,
$$a_{a_{0}}+a_{a_{1}} + \cdots + a_{a_{10}} = 671$$
$$11a_{0}+(a_{0}+a_{1}\cdots + a_{10})d=671$$
$$11a_{0}+209d=671$$

Now, using the first equation, $11a_{0}+55d=209$. Then, subtracting from the second equation, $154d=462\implies d =3$. So, $a_{0}={4}$.
</Solution>
